information regarding our Privacy Shield certification, please click here. When we use the term
"Personal Information" in this Privacy Shield Notice, we are referring to any information that (i)
is recorded in any form; (ii) is about an identified or identifiable individual; and (iii) is
received by us from the EEA, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom.

When we use the term "Sensitive Personal Information" in this Privacy Shield Notice, we are
referring to a particular subset of an individualâ€™s Personal Information that provides details of
his or her race, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, political opinions, religious or philosophical
beliefs, or trade union membership or that concerns his or her health.

The purpose of this Privacy Shield Notice is to outline our general practices for implementing the
Principles with respect to the Personal Information we collect. If you would like to obtain
additional information regarding our privacy practices in connection with information collected on
this website in general, please refer to our online Privacy Notice.

Principles
1. **Notice**. We will provide you with timely and appropriate notice in our Terms of Use and
Privacy Notice, describing what Personal Information we are collecting, how we will use that information.
We do not provide any student data to third parties.
Please review these documents carefully.

2. **Choice**. We will offer you the opportunity to opt-out of your Personal Information (or to provide
explicit consent for Sensitive Personal Information) being:
(i) disclosed to a third party (other than a service provider as set forth below); or 
(ii) used for a purpose materially different from the purpose for which it was originally collected (as set out in our Privacy Notice), or
subsequently authorized by you, when the circumstances arise. You also have the ability to opt out
at any time from the use of your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes. To exercise
this right, please check your settings options. If you have further questions related to the above,
you can also contact us at privacyshield@coursera.org.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that we may disclose Personal Information under the
following circumstances without offering you an opportunity to opt out of such disclosure:
(i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process;
(ii) pursuant to valid requests by law enforcement or other government authorities (which we are legally required to
respond to); and
(iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial
loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.

1. **Data Security**. We will take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect Personal Information from
loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. We have implemented
appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to help safeguard and secure Personal
Information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction.

compatible with and relevant to the purpose for which it was collected or authorized by you. To the
extent necessary for those purposes, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that Personal
Information is accurate, complete, current, and reliable for its intended use.

3. **Access**. Upon request, we will provide you with reasonable access to the Personal Information about
you that we hold. We will also take reasonable steps to correct, update, amend, or delete any

Privacy Shield Notice, and we will provide an independent way to resolve complaints about our
privacy practices. We encourage interested persons to first contact us (contact information provided
