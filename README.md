them, you may also contact us via privacy@coursera.org. If you reside or are located in the EEA,

Data. Please also note that certain Personal Data may be exempt from such requests in certain
circumstances, which may include if we need to retain your Personal Data to comply with a legal

## International Privacy Practices Our Sites are primarily operated and managed on servers located
and operated within the United States. In order to provide our products and Services to you, you may
be sending your Personal Data outside of the country where you reside or are located, including to
the United States. Accordingly, if you reside or are located outside of the United States, your
Personal Data may be transferred outside of the country where you reside or are located, including
to countries that may not or do not provide the same level of protection for your Personal Data. We
are committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of Personal Data when it is transferred.
If you reside or are located within the EEA, United Kingdom, Switzerland, or other region that
offers similar protections, and such transfers occur, we take appropriate steps to provide the same
level of protection for the processing carried out in any such countries as you would have within
the EEA or other regions to the extent feasible under applicable law. We participate in and commit
to adhering to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks when transferring data from the
EEA or Switzerland to the United States. Please see our Privacy Shield Notice below for further
information.

and that these practices are subject to change. Any change, update, or modification will be
effective immediately upon posting on our Site. We will notify you of any material change to this
Privacy Notice by posting a notice on our Site’s homepage for a reasonable period of time following
such update or by sending an email to the email address associated with your user account, and by
changing the effective date (located at the top and bottom of this page). Be sure to return to this

age, then please do not use or access this Site at any time or in any manner. We will take

participating in the live lecture, and that we may make all such content publicly available to all
users of our platform.  Coursera will use your information to provide and operate our Live2Coursera

instructors to know which students have viewed their lectures.  Coursera may also share certain
information about your use of Live2Coursera Services back with any associated Third Party Offering.
Please note that when you interact with any Third Party Offering, such Third Party Offering may
independently collect information about you and solicit information from you. We have no control
over, do not review, and are not responsible for a Third Party Offering's privacy practices. We
recommend that you review any and all Third Party Offering’s privacy notice for more information.

Privacy Shield Notice Effective as of January 1, 2022.

Introduction.  Coursera, Inc. (referred to as "we," "us," or "our"), believes in protecting your
privacy.

We participate in and commit to adhering to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks
which includes the Privacy Shield Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data
integrity, access, and enforcement (the "Principles") for all transfers of personal data from the
EEA, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom to the U.S. To learn more about Privacy Shield, please visit
the U.S. Department of Commerce Privacy Shield website: https://www.privacyshield.gov/. For more
information regarding our Privacy Shield certification, please click here. When we use the term
"Personal Information" in this Privacy Shield Notice, we are referring to any information that (i)
is recorded in any form; (ii) is about an identified or identifiable individual; and (iii) is
received by us from the EEA, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom.

When we use the term "Sensitive Personal Information" in this Privacy Shield Notice, we are
referring to a particular subset of an individual’s Personal Information that provides details of
his or her race, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, political opinions, religious or philosophical
beliefs, or trade union membership or that concerns his or her health.

The purpose of this Privacy Shield Notice is to outline our general practices for implementing the
Principles with respect to the Personal Information we collect. If you would like to obtain
additional information regarding our privacy practices in connection with information collected on
this website in general, please refer to our online Privacy Notice.

Principles
1. **Notice**. We will provide you with timely and appropriate notice in our Terms of Use and
Privacy Notice, describing what Personal Information we are collecting, how we will use that information.
We do not provide any student data to third parties.
Please review these documents carefully.

2. **Choice**. We will offer you the opportunity to opt-out of your Personal Information (or to provide
explicit consent for Sensitive Personal Information) being:
(i) disclosed to a third party (other than a service provider as set forth below); or 
(ii) used for a purpose materially different from the purpose for which it was originally collected (as set out in our Privacy Notice), or
subsequently authorized by you, when the circumstances arise. You also have the ability to opt out
at any time from the use of your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes. To exercise
this right, please check your settings options. If you have further questions related to the above,
you can also contact us at privacyshield@coursera.org.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that we may disclose Personal Information under the
following circumstances without offering you an opportunity to opt out of such disclosure:
(i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process;
(ii) pursuant to valid requests by law enforcement or other government authorities (which we are legally required to
respond to); and
(iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial
loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.

1. **Data Security**. We will take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect Personal Information from
loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. We have implemented
appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to help safeguard and secure Personal
Information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction.

2. **Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation**. We will process Personal Information in a manner that is
compatible with and relevant to the purpose for which it was collected or authorized by you. To the
extent necessary for those purposes, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that Personal
Information is accurate, complete, current, and reliable for its intended use.

3. **Access**. Upon request, we will provide you with reasonable access to the Personal Information about
you that we hold. We will also take reasonable steps to correct, update, amend, or delete any
information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate, except where the burden or expense of doing so
would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy in the case in question.

4. **Recourse; Enforcement**. We will regularly review our compliance with the statements set forth in this
Privacy Shield Notice, and we will provide an independent way to resolve complaints about our
privacy practices. We encourage interested persons to first contact us (contact information provided
below) and we will investigate and attempt to resolve any complaints and disputes regarding use and
disclosure of Personal Information in accordance with the Principles.

## Jurisdiction
As part of our participation in Privacy Shield, we are subject to the investigatory
and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and other authorized statutory bodies.

## Modifications
We may amend this Privacy Shield Notice from time-to-time in accordance with the
requirements of the EU-U.S. or Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework.
The most recent version of the Privacy Shield Notice will always be posted to this website.
Anytime that we do make such changes, we will also update
the effective date listed at the top of the Privacy Shield Notice.
Please be sure to review the most recent version of the Privacy Shield Notice each time that you visit this
website so that you are aware of how we collect, use, and retain personal information.
